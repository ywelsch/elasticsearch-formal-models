`^\Large\bf
TLA+ Model of an improved Zen consensus algorithm ^'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------- MODULE zen -----------------------------------------
\* Imported modules used in this specification
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences, TLC

----

\* `^\Large\bf Constants ^'

\* The specification first defines the constants of the model, which amount to values or sets of
\* values that are fixed.

\* Set of node ids (all master-eligible nodes)
CONSTANTS Nodes

\* The constant "Nil" denotes a place-holder for a non-existing value
CONSTANTS Nil

\* RPC message types
CONSTANTS
  Ping,
  Join, \* only request is modeled
  AppendEntries,
  Apply \* only request is modeled

CONSTANTS
  Pinging, \* initial state, pinging is done in this state
  Become_Follower, \* pinging established another node should be master, send join request to that node
  Follower, \* node succefully joined a cluster
  Become_Master, \* pinging established this node should be master, wait for joins
  Master \* node successfully became the master (received enough joins and starts publishing CS)

----

\* `^\Large\bf Variables ^'

\* The following describes the variable state of the model.

\* Set of in-flight requests and responses sent between nodes.
VARIABLE messages

\* For simplicity we assume that each cluster state update chooses a new unique value to be added
\* to the cluster state. This allows us to check that nodes have a consistent view on CS updates.
VARIABLE nextUUID

\* The following variables capture state on a per-node basis (maps with domain Nodes).
VARIABLE discoPhase \* map from Nodes to {Pinging, Become_Follower, Follower, Become_Master, Master}

(*
  cluster state: record containing the following fields:
    nodes: subset of nodes that are part of cluster,
    master: the current master of the cluster (either a node id or Nil)
    term: the term with which this CS was published
    version: the version of the CS, incremented on each update
    data: the content of the cluster state (sequence of client events, which is just a unique number assigned on each new client request) 
*)
VARIABLE discoState \* persisted cluster state, used by disco module, persisted whenever updated
VARIABLE term \* used by disco module, persisted
VARIABLE appliedState \* state visible to the other modules on the node

----

\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x >= y 

\* Remove request from the set of messages and add response instead
Reply(response, request) == messages' = {response} \cup (messages \ {request})

\* quorums correspond to majority of nodes
Quorum == {ns \in SUBSET(Nodes) : Cardinality(ns) * 2 > Cardinality(Nodes)}

\* initial cluster state for node n
